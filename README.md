I’m excited to share something I’ve always wanted to make for myself — and it ended up becoming a short guidebook!

A beginner-friendly (but also advanced-user approved) guide to 51 of the most useful Linux commands — Some I use almost every day some not.
Written to be simple, practical, and easy to reference.

📄 **Free PDF included** — clean A4 layout, color-coded, and ready to print or browse.
